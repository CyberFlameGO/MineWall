# MineWall

MineWall is a Layer 3 mitigation toolset for protocol specifications like Minecraft. It uses forensic data from multiple providers and experience working with 4 figure player Minecraft networks.

It is mainly targeted at Minecraft servers, or applications having a similar networking footprint as the former. However, it may work well for other applications where proxies are the main tool used for attacks. It is highly recommended to test pre-deployment, and to take proper measures to optimize for your own end use-case.
